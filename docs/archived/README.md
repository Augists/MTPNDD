# Archived Optimization Notes

This directory contains write-ups of specific performance/concurrency changes, intended as citable engineering notes (e.g., for papers).

Each file follows the same rough structure:
- Motivation / symptom
- Root cause (with evidence when available)
- Implementation approach (with file paths)
- Verification and performance results (commands + outputs)
- Risks and follow-ups
